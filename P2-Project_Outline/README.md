### Overview

### What I'll Have to Learn
I am newish to Rocket. I understand HTTP Requests, HTTP Responses, and serving up templates. I don't know how to connect to a DB, or of any ORM's in Rust. I will have to do some research on what is available, and what makes sense for a project of this size. I also will have to dive deeper into Handlebar Templates -- mainly fragmenting, and reusing templates within templates.
